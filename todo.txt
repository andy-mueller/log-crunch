-Provide http query mechanism
 GET http://localhost:8080/logcrunch/filter?fileName=machine01-%d{yyyMMdd}.log&searchRange=2007-05-07T13:55:22,100/2009-07-02&level=Info&level=Warn

-return a 404 "nothing found", if the filtered returns nothing.
  -Elaborate on the reason in the log message:
    -no file(s) found in path
    -no lines to display
  -is it appropriate to throw exception in this case??
    -where are the exceptions located? In the interactor?
    -error handling shall be done in decorator
    -do we need a boundary/interactor interface
  -alt.: provide onError handler for interactor
    -in both cases, the interactor decides if this condition occurs,
     but here exceptions are hot used for the cntroll flow!!
    -this is tell don't ask!

-logging facilities for this application
    -log full request in debug mode

-More filtering
    -filter logger with regex
    -filter message with regex

-how to build file name patterns
    -should they be provided from the client?
    -alt.:interactor build them from different parts of the query

-allow for multiple search paths


-LogbackLogLine: pass format string as second ctor parameter
    -eliminate date time formatter
    -use logback itself for parsing??

-provide decorator base class for LogFile. Fix FilterLogFile then

-parse multiline log lines
    -implementation inside LogLineFactory. This is probably logback
     specific and should be implemented in  the according package
